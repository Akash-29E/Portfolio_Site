                        <h1>About Me ðŸŒŸ</h1>
                        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Akash â€” a Quality Assurance Engineer turned Web Developer who loves transforming ideas into clean, responsive, and meaningful digital experiences. My journey started with breaking things to make them better â€” and now I build them better from the start.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a sharp eye for detail shaped by years in QA, I approach development with both precision and curiosity. Whether itâ€™s designing intuitive front-end interfaces or crafting efficient back-end logic, I enjoy solving complex problems through simple, elegant code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Iâ€™m passionate about creating web experiences that feel good â€” fast, accessible, and thoughtfully designed. I thrive in learning new technologies, collaborating with creative minds, and pushing every project a bit further than expected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually exploring design trends, refining personal projects, or chasing that perfect balance between logic and creativity â€” the art of building something that just works beautifully.
                        </p>
